### Introduction

This project aims to explore and analyze the Wisconsin Breast Cancer dataset using different supervised learning techniques. The experiments are divided into two main studies: Regression and Classification.

### Regression Study

- **Objective**: Investigate how much the **mean radius** feature is affected by other tumor features.
- **Methods**: Two linear regression models were utilized.
- **Approach**: 
  - Evaluate the performance of the two models with different training set sizes.
  - Analyze how the **change in training set size** impacts model performance.

### Classification Study

- **Objective**: Predict the **diagnosis** (benign or malignant) based on tumor characteristics.
- **Methods**: Five supervised learning algorithms were evaluated.
- **Approach**: 
  - Determine the **outstanding algorithm** for diagnosis prediction.
  - Identify features most associated with the diagnosis of a **malignant mass**.

# Run the regression analysis
Run the regression analysis:

  Convert the notebook to a script and execute it:

```bash
jupyter nbconvert --to script regression_analysis.ipynb
python regression_analysis.py
```

Alternatively, run the notebook directly:

Firstly you need to install papermill:

```bash
pip install papermill
```

```bash
papermill regression_analysis.ipynb output_regression.ipynb
```bash

Run the classification analysis:

Convert the notebook to a script and execute it:

```bash
jupyter nbconvert --to script classification_analysis.ipynb
python classification_analysis.py
```

Alternatively, run the notebook directly:

```bash
papermill classification_analysis.ipynb output_classification.ipynb
```

### Results
Regression Study

    Objective: Investigate the influence of other tumor features on the mean radius.
    Methods: Two linear regression models with different training set sizes.
    Key Findings:
        Model performance varies with training set size.
        Detailed results and performance metrics (e.g., RÂ², MAE) can be found in the regression_analysis_results.txt file generated by the script.

Classification Study

    Objective: Predict the diagnosis (benign or malignant) based on tumor features.
    Methods: Evaluation of five supervised learning algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest).
    Key Findings:
        Identification of the best-performing algorithm based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
        Important features associated with malignant diagnoses highlighted.
        Detailed results and performance metrics can be found in the classification_analysis_results.txt file generated by the script.
