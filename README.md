### Introduction

This project aims to explore and analyze the Wisconsin Breast Cancer dataset using different supervised learning techniques. The experiments are divided into two main studies: Regression and Classification.

### Regression Study

- **Objective**: Investigate how much the **mean radius** feature is affected by other tumor features.
- **Methods**: Two linear regression models were utilized.
- **Approach**:
  - Determine the feature that **most affects** the mean radius
  - Analyze how the **change in training set size** impacts model performance.

### Classification Study

- **Objective**: Predict the **diagnosis** (benign or malignant) based on tumor characteristics.
- **Methods**: Five supervised learning algorithms were evaluated.
- **Approach**:
  - Define the features most associated with the diagnosis of **a malignant mass.**
  - Determine the **outstanding algorithm** for diagnosis prediction.


### Results
Regression Study

    Objective: Investigate the influence of other tumor features on the mean radius.
    Methods: Two Linear Regression models with different training set sizes were employed.
    Key Findings:
        Model performance varies with training set size.
        The features that most/least or positively/negatively affect the mean radius feature were identified.
        Detailed results and performance metrics (e.g., RÂ², MAE) can be found in the [wisconsin_lnr_reg.ipynb](./wisconsin_lnr_reg.ipynb)  [LICENSE file](./LICENSE) file.
        
Classification Study

    Objective: Predict the diagnosis (benign or malignant) based on tumor features.
    Methods: Evaluation of five Supervised Learning algorithms 
    Key Findings:
        The best performing algorithm was identified based on classification reports and graphs.
        Important features associated with malignant diagnoses highlighted.
        Detailed results and performance metrics can be found in the wisconsin_models.ipynb file in the wisconsin_classification folder
