### Introduction

This project aims to explore and analyze the Wisconsin Breast Cancer dataset using different supervised learning techniques. The experiments are divided into two main studies: Regression and Classification.

### Regression Study

- **Objective**: Investigate how much the **mean radius** feature is affected by other tumor features.
- **Methods**: Two linear regression models were utilized.
- **Approach**:
  - Determine the feature that **most affects** the mean radius
  - Evaluate the performance of the two models with different training set sizes.
  - Analyze how the **change in training set size** impacts model performance.

### Classification Study

- **Objective**: Predict the **diagnosis** (benign or malignant) based on tumor characteristics.
- **Methods**: Five supervised learning algorithms were evaluated.
- **Approach**:
  - Define the features most associated with the diagnosis of **a malignant mass.**
  - Determine the **outstanding algorithm** for diagnosis prediction.
  - Identify features most associated with the diagnosis of a **malignant mass**.

### Installation

To run the code in this repository, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.10.13
- Pandas 2.2.1
- Scikit-learn 1.5.0
- NumPy 1.26.4
- Matplotlib 3.8.3
- Seaborn 0.13.2
- Statsmodels 0.14.1

### Usage

To use the code in this repository, follow these steps:

Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/breast_cancer_supervised.git
```

Navigate to the project directory

```bash
cd breast_cancer_supervised
```

Install the required dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

# Run the regression analysis
Run the regression analysis:

  Convert the notebook to a script and execute it:

```bash
jupyter nbconvert --to script regression_analysis.ipynb
python regression_analysis.py
```

Alternatively, run the notebook directly:

  Firstly you need to install papermill:

```bash
pip install papermill
```

```bash
papermill regression_analysis.ipynb output_regression.ipynb
```

Run the classification analysis:

Convert the notebook to a script and execute it:

```bash
jupyter nbconvert --to script classification_analysis.ipynb
python classification_analysis.py
```

Alternatively, run the notebook directly with papermill:

```bash
papermill classification_analysis.ipynb output_classification.ipynb
```

### Results
Regression Study

    Objective: Investigate the influence of other tumor features on the mean radius.
    Methods: Two linear regression models with different training set sizes.
    Key Findings:
        Model performance varies with training set size.
        The features that most/least or positively/negatively affect the mean radius feature were identified.
        Detailed results and performance metrics (e.g., RÂ², MAE) can be found in the wisconsin_lnr_reg.ipynb file in the wisconsin_regression folder

Classification Study

    Objective: Predict the diagnosis (benign or malignant) based on tumor features.
    Methods: Evaluation of five Supervised Learning algorithms 
    Key Findings:
        The best performing algorithm was identified based on classification reports and graphs.
        Important features associated with malignant diagnoses highlighted.
        Detailed results and performance metrics can be found in the wisconsin_models.ipynb file in the wisconsin_classification folder
