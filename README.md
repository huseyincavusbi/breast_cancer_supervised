## Superivsed Learning Experiments on Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset

This repository contains various experiments with Supervised Machine Learning models on the Wisconsin Breast Cancer dataset. 

### In the Regression study; 
  **Two Linear Regression models** were used to investigate the question of how much the **Mean radius** feature is affected by other tumour features. The performance of two linear  regression models with different training set sizes were evaluated. It is investigated how the **change in training set size** affects the model performance. 

### In the Classification study;  
  **Five supervised learning algorithms** were used to predict the **diagnosis** based on tumour characteristics. The algorithms were evaluated and the **outstanding algorithm** was determined. Also, the features most associated with the diagnosis of **malignant mass** were identified.
