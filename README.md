### Introduction

This project aims to explore and analyze the Wisconsin Breast Cancer dataset using different supervised learning techniques. The experiments are divided into two main studies: Regression and Classification.

### Regression Study

- **Objective**: Investigate how much the **mean radius** feature is affected by other tumor features.
- **Methods**: Two linear regression models were utilized.
- **Approach**: 
  - Evaluate the performance of the two models with different training set sizes.
  - Analyze how the **change in training set size** impacts model performance.

### Classification Study

- **Objective**: Predict the **diagnosis** (benign or malignant) based on tumor characteristics.
- **Methods**: Five supervised learning algorithms were evaluated.
- **Approach**: 
  - Determine the **outstanding algorithm** for diagnosis prediction.
  - Identify features most associated with the diagnosis of a **malignant mass**.

### Installation

- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Statsmodels
You can install the required packages using:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Usage

To use the code in this repository, follow these steps:
Clone the repository

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/breast_cancer_supervised.git

Navigate to the project directory

cd breast_cancer_supervised

Install the required dependencies

pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the regression analysis

Execute the script for the regression study:

python regression_analysis.py

This script will perform linear regression on the dataset and evaluate the impact of different training set sizes on model performance.
Run the classification analysis

Execute the script for the classification study:

python classification_analysis.py

This script will apply various supervised learning algorithms to predict the diagnosis based on tumor characteristics and identify the best-performing model.

###Results
Regression Study

    Objective: Investigate the influence of other tumor features on the mean radius.
    Methods: Two linear regression models with different training set sizes.
    Key Findings:
        Model performance varies with training set size.
        Detailed results and performance metrics (e.g., RÂ², MAE) can be found in the regression_analysis_results.txt file generated by the script.

Classification Study

    Objective: Predict the diagnosis (benign or malignant) based on tumor features.
    Methods: Evaluation of five supervised learning algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest).
    Key Findings:
        Identification of the best-performing algorithm based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
        Important features associated with malignant diagnoses highlighted.
        Detailed results and performance metrics can be found in the classification_analysis_results.txt file generated by the script.
